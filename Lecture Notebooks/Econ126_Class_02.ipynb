An excellent print resource is *Python Programming for Beginners* by Jason Cannon. A more comprehensive reference is *Python 3 for Absolute Beginners* by Tim Hall and J-P Stacey (Available as a free PDF download from the UCI library). Chapter 2 from *Economic Dynamics* by John Stachurski is an exceletn introduction to both programming in general and programming in Python specifically. *Part 1: Programming in Python* of Thomas J. Sargent and John Stachurskiâ€™s Python lectures at http://lectures.quantecon.org/py/index.html also contains a nice introduction."

Sometimes functions require one or more inputs called *arguments*. Individual arguments may be either *required* or *optional* depending on the function. Python includes many built-in functions. You may also create a *user-defined* function by defining your own function and we'll cover how to do that later.\n",
