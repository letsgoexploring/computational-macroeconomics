Randomness is necessary for two reasons. First, from a practical point of view, any model will be incomplete and will not fit the data perfectly and so randomness in a macroeconomic model is analagous to an error term in an OLS model. Second, from a philosophical perspective, randomness in a macroeconomic model reflects economists' consensus that fundamentally unpredictable forces cause the business cycle.\n",

The reason is that the first theory that we will encounter is called *real business cycle* or RBC theory and, in that theory, there is no place for nominal quantities.
