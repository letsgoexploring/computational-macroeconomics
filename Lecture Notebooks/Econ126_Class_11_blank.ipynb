                "Dynamic optimization, the optimal choice over elements in a time series, is at the heart of macroeconomic theory. People and firms routinely make decisions that affect their future opportunities. For example, a household chooses how much of its income to save and therefore allocates some of its current consumption to the future. In this Notebook, we consider a simple two-period dynamic optimization model. A person has some initial quantity of cake and chooses the optimal way to eat it over the next two periods. We solve for the optimal consumption path.\n",
