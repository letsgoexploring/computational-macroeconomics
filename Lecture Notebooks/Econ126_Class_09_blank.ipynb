Colloquially, the term refers to the alternating periods of expansion and contraction in the macroeconomy. Business cycle fluctuations are costly because they are associated with misallocations of capital and labor. Recessions are particularly painful for workers that become unemployed and for the families of workers who become unemployed. The costs of the business cycle have driven research into understanding the cause of the cycle. \n",

The GDP, consumption, investment, and capital data are in terms of 2012 dollars. Hours is measured as an index with the value in October 2012 set to 100. All of the data are *real* quantities. That is, there are no *nominal* quantities like money or inflation or a nominal interest rate. The reason is that the first theory that we will encounter is called *real business cycle* or RBC theory and, in that theory, there is no place for nominal quantities. RBC theory seeks to explain fluctuations in real quantities as being primarily due to TFP shocks; i.e., shocks to the production function."
